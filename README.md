# Multi-Warehouse Inventory Management System

## Overview

Enhance the existing Multi-Warehouse Inventory Management System built with Next.js and Material-UI (MUI) for GreenSupply Co, a sustainable product distribution company. The current system is functional but needs significant improvements to be production-ready.

## üéØ Business Context

GreenSupply Co distributes eco-friendly products across multiple warehouse locations throughout North America. They need to efficiently track inventory across warehouses, manage stock movements, monitor inventory values, and prevent stockouts. This system is critical for their daily operations and customer satisfaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) - UI component library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
- JSON file storage (for this assessment)

## üìã Current Features (Already Implemented)

The basic system includes:

- ‚úÖ Products management (CRUD operations)
- ‚úÖ Warehouse management (CRUD operations)
- ‚úÖ Stock level tracking per warehouse
- ‚úÖ Basic dashboard with inventory overview
- ‚úÖ Navigation between pages
- ‚úÖ Data persistence using JSON files

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** The current UI is intentionally basic. We want to see YOUR design skills and creativity.

## üöÄ Your Tasks (Complete ALL 3)

---

## Task 1: Redesign & Enhance the Dashboard

**Objective:** Transform the basic dashboard into a professional, insightful command center for warehouse operations.

### Requirements:

Redesign the dashboard to provide warehouse managers with actionable insights at a glance. Your implementation should include:

- **Modern, professional UI** appropriate for a sustainable/eco-friendly company
- **Key business metrics** (inventory value, stock levels, warehouse counts, etc.)
- **Data visualizations** using a charting library of your choice
- **Enhanced inventory overview** with improved usability
- **Fully responsive design** that works across all device sizes
- **Proper loading states** and error handling

Focus on creating an interface that balances visual appeal with practical functionality for daily warehouse operations.

---

## Task 2: Implement Stock Transfer System

**Objective:** Build a complete stock transfer workflow with proper business logic, validation, and data integrity.

### Requirements:

**A. Stock Transfer System**

Build a complete stock transfer system that allows moving inventory between warehouses. Your implementation should include:

- Data persistence for transfer records (create `data/transfers.json`)
- API endpoints for creating and retrieving transfers
- Proper validation and error handling
- Stock level updates across warehouses
- Transfer history tracking

Design the data structure, API contracts, and business logic as you see fit for a production system.

**B. Transfer Page UI**

Create a `/transfers` page that provides:

- A form to initiate stock transfers between warehouses
- Transfer history view
- Appropriate error handling and user feedback

Design the interface to be intuitive for warehouse managers performing daily operations.

---

## Task 3: Build Low Stock Alert & Reorder System

**Objective:** Create a practical system that helps warehouse managers identify and act on low stock situations.

### Requirements:

Build a low stock alert and reorder recommendation system that helps warehouse managers proactively manage inventory levels.

**Key Functionality:**

- Identify products that need reordering based on current stock levels and reorder points
- Categorize inventory by stock status (critical, low, adequate, overstocked)
- Provide actionable reorder recommendations
- Allow managers to track and update alert status
- Integrate alerts into the main dashboard

**Implementation Details:**

- Create an `/alerts` page for viewing and managing alerts
- Calculate stock across all warehouses
- Persist alert tracking data (create `data/alerts.json`)
- Design appropriate status workflows and user actions

Use your judgment to determine appropriate thresholds, calculations, and user workflows for a production inventory management system.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

**Name:** Mehdi Behboudi
**Completion Time:** ~18 hours
**Live Application:** https://inventoryapplication.vercel.app
**Video Walkthrough:** https://youtu.be/FGtBP_dH5Qc (a little longer than excpected because of the said reasons in the video)

### Features Completed

- **Task 1: Dashboard Redesign:** Fully responsive, modern UI with three data visualization charts (Recharts) and key metric cards. Converted the dashboard to SSR for performance.
- **Task 2: Stock Transfer System:** Complete UI and API for stock movements with real-time stock availability display, client/server-side validation, and transfer history tracking. Implemented atomic stock updates in the backend.
- **Task 3: Low Stock Alert & Reorder System:** Logic to categorize inventory (Critical, Low, Adequate). Dedicated `/alerts` page for viewing/managing alerts (Acknowledge/Resolve). Integrated alert count and status into the Dashboard.
- **Optional Enhancements (Goes Beyond Requirements):**
  - **Live Vercel Deployment:** Deployed the application live for easy review and showcasing the finished product.
  - **Full TypeScript Migration:** Converted the entire project for superior type safety and developer experience.
  - **Dark/Light Mode:** Implemented a full color theme switch using **React's Context API** for global state management.

### Key Technical Decisions

1.  **Full TypeScript Migration:** Converted the entire project to **TypeScript** (TSX/TS) from the start to ensure superior type safety, better tooling, and improved developer experience, anticipating future scalability. _(This decision was made even though it was an optional bonus, prioritizing architecture.)_
2.  **Centralized Data Service:** Created a single **`dataService.ts`** utility to abstract and consolidate all API/data operations, significantly improving code maintainability and reusability.
3.  **Atomic Stock Logic:** Implemented a transactional approach in the transfer API to ensure stock subtraction from the source and addition to the destination are treated as a single, dependent operation to guarantee data integrity.
4.  **Performance Refactor:** Migrated the main Dashboard page to **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** to improve initial load speed.

### Known Limitations & Trade-Offs

- **Data Persistence:** The core limitation is the mandated use of JSON file storage, which is not suitable for concurrent writes in a production environment. A **PostgreSQL/Prisma** setup\*\* is the immediate next step.
- **Testing:** Due to the time constraint, full unit and integration tests were not implemented, though the critical transfer logic was manually tested extensively.

### New Dependencies Added

- `recharts`: For data visualization on the dashboard.
- `typescript`, `@types/react`, `@types/node`: For the full TypeScript migration.
